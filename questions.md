# singleCellRNA

## Plan for the evening:

Part I:

(15 min talk + 15 min questions and discussion) x3
- Rebekka Wegmann - Chemical Biology & Therapeutics, NIBR. 
“Benchmarking and refining a general workflow for the analysis of scRNASeq data: Key challenges and conclusions”

- Panagiotis Papasaikas - Computational Biology, FMI. 
“A primer on single-cell computational analyses”

- Jack Kuipers - Computational Biology Group, ETH Zurich. 
“Single-cell phylogenetics: current challenges and future directions”

Part II:

- Panel discussion (30 min)

This is not a conference. We endeavor to leave a lot of time for discussion and our aim is to gather enough people together to have conversations whatever your level, be it exploring the possibilities for your project, getting over a block in your own analysis or satisfying a general interest.

**When:** January 25, 2018 – 5-7pm

**Where:** Novartis Personalrestaurant - Gärtnerstrasse 2, 4057 Basel (WKL-610-P-AUD_M | Tram station: Ciba – See red box in map below)
